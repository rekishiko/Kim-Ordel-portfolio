 <!-- Project Page header and intro text --> 
<h1 class="text-center">Projects</h1>

<p class="text-center"> I believe the best way to learn is by doing. I thrive on hands-on challenges and recognize that the most valuable lessons come from the struggle itself. For me, failure is just a step toward success and an opportunity to grow my problem-solving skills. I have broken my projects down into two categories: Independent and Guided. </p>

<!-- information on independent projects-->
<h3 class="text-center">Independent Projects</h3>

<p class="text-center"> 
These are projects where I did not have guidance or step-by-step instructions to complete them. This includes class assignments where I was given a task and had to figure out how to achieve the required features and functionality. It also includes personal projects I developed from scratch to challenge myself and grow my skills. </p>


<!-- information on guided projects-->
<h3 class="text-center">Guided Projects</h3>

<p class="text-center"> These are projects where I used a book or online tutorial for guidance. While I followed a set path, I learned by actively working through the process and troubleshooting challenges as I went. I often took the extra step to modify the projects to challenge myself further.
