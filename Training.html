<p class="text-center paragraph"> My journey to becoming a software engineer began in Spring 2024 when I made the decision to pursue a career that would challenge me intellectually and allow me to collaborate with others to create innovative products. I began with self-study, first focusing on Python and then expanding to other topics such as AI, Java, HTML and Agile. While I quickly discovered a passion for coding, I realized I needed structure to guide my learning so I enrolled in the University of the People's Computer Science bachelor's program. This decision has provided me structure and guidance, allowing me to advance my skills and encounter topics I would not have otherwise.</p>

<p class="text-center paragraph">Since deciding to become a software engineer, I have learned from various resources and remain committed to continuous learning. I believe that in this field, as in many others, staying current with industry changes and consistently bettering ourselves is crucial for both professional growth and achieving success. </p>

<p class="text-center paragraph" >This page serves as a detailed overview of my training journey, highlighting my dedication and the skills I have acquired. I believe that every learning opportunity, regardless of its size, is a chance to grow professionally and personally. My belief in self-improvement is guided by my grandfather’s optimism. Whenever there was an achievement my grandfather always said “another success,” a reminder that no matter how small, each achievement is a success that builds upon the last. </p>

      <!-- put this info in a pop up for "more info" for the developer course -->
  <!-- <p> This course, "Python Development" from Sololearn, provided a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of intermediate and advanced Python concepts. The curriculum covered fundamental building blocks, including various data types and their conversions, as well as complex comparison and logical operations. Students learned to implement efficient control flow using both for and while loops and mastered advanced data structures like tuples, dictionaries, and sets. The course also provided a solid foundation in functional programming through the creation of custom functions, including the use of lambda expressions and the flexible handling of arguments with args and kwargs.</p>

  <p> More than just a coding course, the Python Development curriculum focused on a developer-centric approach to programming. It introduced students to professional best practices and coding standards necessary for building clean and maintainable projects. A key emphasis was placed on debugging, teaching students effective strategies for identifying and resolving issues as they arose during development. The course also covered robust error handling by introducing the concept of exceptions and how to properly implement them to prevent program crashes. </p>

  <p> The program also delved into the theoretical underpinnings of software development. It provided a detailed understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance, data hiding, and the use of decorators. Students learned the practical application of these concepts by working with class and static methods, which are crucial for creating reusable and scalable code. This comprehensive approach ensured that students not only learned the syntax but also understood the core principles required to develop sophisticated and well-structured applications.
