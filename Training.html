<p class="text-center"> My journey to becoming a software engineer began in Spring 2024 when I made the decision to pursue a career that would challenge me intellectually and allow me to collaborate with others to create innovative products. I began with self-study, first focusing on Python and then expanding to other topics such as AI, Java, HTML and Agile. While I quickly discovered a passion for coding, I realized I needed structure to guide my learning so I enrolled in the University of the People's Computer Science bachelor's program. This decision has provided me structure and guidance, allowing me to advance my skills and encounter topics I would not have otherwise.</p>

<p class="text-center">Since deciding to become a software engineer, I have learned from various resources and remain committed to continuous learning. I believe that in this field, as in many others, staying current with industry changes and consistently bettering ourselves is crucial for both professional growth and achieving success. </p>

<p class="text-center" >This page serves as a detailed overview of my training journey, highlighting my dedication and the skills I have acquired. I believe that every learning opportunity, regardless of its size, is a chance to grow professionally and personally. My belief in self-improvement is guided by my grandfather’s optimism. Whenever there was an achievement my grandfather always said “another success,” a reminder that no matter how small, each achievement is a success that builds upon the last. </p>
